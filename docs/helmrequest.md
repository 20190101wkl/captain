HelmRequest is a CRD that defines how to install a helm charts. It's kindly like the helm cli, you can set various options when install a helm charts. But with HelmRequest, it easier to persistent the configuration, and because we now have a controller, which can ensure to successfully install the chats by retrying automatically.  This can solve a lot of problems when using helm chats in helm 2, such "resource already exist" , bluh,blushâ€¦.



A basic HelmRequest looks like this(after setting some defauts):



```yaml
