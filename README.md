Captain is a Helm 3 Controller

## About Helm3 

The [Helm 3 Design Proposal](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/helm-v3/000-helm-v3.md) has been exist for a while, and the helm 
developer group is focused on the core helm 3 development, this is the first implementation of Helm3 Controller based on the Proposal.

This project is based on the core [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) code, which promised to be act as an library. Since it's not official
